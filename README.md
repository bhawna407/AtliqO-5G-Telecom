👥 Active Users Trends

Active users showed an overall upward trend post-5G, indicating positive adoption, though growth varied across regions.

Metro cities contributed the highest share of active users, while smaller cities showed slower adoption.

Some months reflected MoM fluctuations, signaling potential churn or seasonal usage behavior.

💰 Total Revenue Analysis

Total revenue increased from approximately ₹354 Cr to peaks above ₹419 Cr, reflecting positive 5G monetization.

Revenue dips in certain months indicate plan fatigue or competitive pressure.

ARPU trends suggest that premium users contributed disproportionately to revenue growth.
